While I understand the goal of protecting public health and curbing youth tobacco use, a complete ban on flavored tobacco may have unintended consequences. Many adults who use these products prefer flavors like menthol or fruit. Banning these options could limit harm reduction alternatives for those trying to quit smoking. Additionally, small businesses, including local tobacco retailers, would be adversely affected by this ban. Instead of outright bans, letâ€™s focus on education and prevention programs to discourage youth tobacco use. Empowering individuals with information is more effective than prohibition. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\nSincerely,');
